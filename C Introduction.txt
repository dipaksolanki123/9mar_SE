Low level language-- Machine Language-- 0 and 1(Binary Language)

High level language-- C,C++,python,Java



SDLC:- Software Development Life Cycle

There are six phases of SDLC:-

1) Requirements Gathering

2) Analysis

3) Designing(Frontend)

4) Coding(Backend)

5) Testing

6) Maintainence


Dev C++, Visual Studio Code


Compiler-- Compile time error:-

It translates the high level language to low level langauage.
It works as a translator.
It runs whole code at once and then give result

Examples:- C,C++


Interpreter-- Run time error:-

It runs code line by line

Examples:- Python



C Programming:-

Language:- A way to communicate

C language is used to build a application

C is a mother of all programming langauges

Grammar

{
	coding...
